use diff -u in the command line to compare 2 files
git is named after English slang git !!

git saves manually
in git terminology, user-created checkpoints are called commits
a repository contains a single file or a collection of files
a commit is a snapshot of every file in your repository when the commit is submitted 

to see colored output in git do this:
git config --global color.ui auto


clone
log
diff
checkout

checking out to a commit means resetting all your files to the state they were in when the commit was made

Compare two commits, printing each line that is present in one commit but not the other.

git diff will do this. It takes two arguments - the two commit ids to compare. 


Make a copy of an entire Git repository, including the history, onto your own computer.

git clone will do this. It takes one argument - the url of the repository to copy. 


Temporarily reset all files in a directory to their state at the time of a specific commit.

git checkout will do this. It takes one argument - the commit ID to restore. 


Show the commits made in this repository, starting with the most recent.

git log will do this. It doesn't take any arguments.

Git repositories
================

git files are stored in .git directory

git init — initializes git in an existing directory

git status — shows which files have changed since the last commit

git add — adds a file to the staging area (list of files to be committed)

Git commits
===========

Good practice to write commit messages as a command, for example:

“Add a recipe for strawberry cheesecake”

git commit — commits the changes (from the staging the area)

git diff — with no args compares files in working directory to staging area

git diff —- staged

runs the diff between files in the staging area and files in the repository (already committed)

git reset —- hard

discards changes in the staging area and the working directory BE CAREFUL WITH THIS

Branches
=========
